Ecom Express Sales Analysis | Power BI Project

This project is a complete sales analysis for a fictional e-commerce brand. I built it to show how I approach real business problems using data. The report covers revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, cancellations, and lost revenue, giving a clear view of how the business is performing across India.

As a Business & Data Analyst, I focused on creating a dashboard that answers the questions decision-makers care about:
What’s working? What’s not? Where are we losing money? And what should we improve next?

🔍 Project Overview

The goal was to analyze sales activity for 2024 and convert raw CSV data into meaningful insights. The final Power BI dashboard highlights:

Total revenue generated

Order volume and average order value

Top-performing products and categories

Revenue contribution by states

Monthly revenue trend

Cancellation rate and potential revenue loss

The dataset consists of three CSV files: Customers, Orders, and Products, along with a Power BI dashboard that brings the analysis together.

📊 Key Insights
1. Revenue and Sales Performance

Total Revenue: ₹1.25B

Total Sales Value: ₹1.77B

Total Orders: 15.69K

Average Order Value (AOV): ₹112.85K

2. Cancellations & Lost Revenue

Cancellation Rate: 29.72%

Lost Revenue: ₹525.42M
This is a major area for improvement and suggests issues with customer fulfillment, delivery experience, or product expectations.

3. Top States by Revenue

Maharashtra

Gujarat

Rajasthan
These regions show the strongest buyer activity and can be targeted for marketing and seasonal campaigns.

4. Best-Performing Categories

Laptops

Mobiles

Headphones
These categories drive most of the business and have consistent demand.

5. Revenue Trend Over Time

The revenue chart shows steady performance across 2024 with noticeable spikes during key months, likely linked to promotions or seasonal events.

Data Model
The analysis is built on three key tables:
1. Customers include customer profile details like city, state, phone brand, and operating system.
2. Orders include purchase date, product, customer, quantity, and delivery status.
3. Products include product name, category, price, rating, and number of ratings.

The tables were modeled using one-to-many relationships:
1. Customers → Orders
2. Products → Orders

3. Revenue trend line chart
4. Revenue by category
