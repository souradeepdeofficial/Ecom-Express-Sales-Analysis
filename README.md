Ecom Express Sales Analysis | Power BI Project

This project is a complete sales analysis for a fictional e-commerce brand. I built it to show how I approach real business problems using data. The report covers revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, cancellations, and lost revenue, giving a clear view of how the business is performing across India.

As a Business & Data Analyst, I focused on creating a dashboard that answers the questions decision-makers care about:
What’s working? What’s not? Where are we losing money? And what should we improve next?

Project Overview: The goal was to analyze sales activity for 2024 and convert raw CSV data into meaningful insights. The final Power BI dashboard highlights:
1. Total revenue generated
2. Order volume and average order value
3. Top-performing products and categories
4. Revenue contribution by states
5. Monthly revenue trend
6. Cancellation rate and potential revenue loss

The dataset consists of three CSV files: Customers, Orders, and Products, along with a Power BI dashboard that brings the analysis together.

Key Insights:
1. Revenue and Sales Performance: Total Revenue: ₹1.25B, Total Sales Value: ₹1.77B, Total Orders: 15.69K, Average Order Value (AOV): ₹112.85K
2. Cancellations & Lost Revenue: Cancellation Rate: 29.72%, Lost Revenue: ₹525.42M
3. Top States by Revenue: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan. These regions show the strongest buyer activity and can be targeted for marketing and seasonal campaigns.
4. Best-Performing Categories: Laptops, Mobiles, Headphones. These categories drive most of the business and have consistent demand.
5. Revenue Trend Over Time: The revenue chart shows steady performance across 2024 with noticeable spikes during key months, likely linked to promotions or seasonal events.

The data model of this analysis is built on three key tables:
1. Customers include customer profile details like city, state, phone brand, and operating system.
2. Orders include purchase date, product, customer, quantity, and delivery status.
3. Products include product name, category, price, rating, and number of ratings.

The tables were modeled using one-to-many relationships:
1. Customers → Orders
2. Products → Orders

Dashboard Features
1. The Power BI report includes:
2. KPI cards for high-level metrics
3. Revenue trend line chart
4. Revenue by category
5. Revenue by product
